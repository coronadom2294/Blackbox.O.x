function [a, d]=filterbank_abank{x,h0,f0,Pa,Ua,Kp,Ku,pph,intel}
% [a,d]=ABANK(x,h0,f0,Pa,Ua,Kp,pph,intel)
% Filter bank: Analysis, one iteration.
% No boundary effects are taken into account. Signal need not be of length power-of-two.

%INPUTY

%x   input signal
%h0,f0  the filter coefficients
%Pa,Ua,Kp,Ku  the lifting operators
%pph  1 Time-domain full bitrate (inefficient);
% 2 time-domain polyphase (inefficient);
% 3 Z-domain polyphase (fast, default)
% 4 Lifting


%Output
%a  Approximation (lowpass, scaling) coefficients
%d  Detail (Highpass, wavelet) coefficients
